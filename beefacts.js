fact: "Bumblebees (genus Bombus) have an unusual way of incubating their eggs. Queens create a little straw nest for their eggs and sit on them to keep them warm, much like birds do.

By placing her abdomen over the eggs she is able to control their temperature, speeding up the development of her young. Once the eggs have hatched and the larvae have emerged, she will continue to keep her daughters warm until they are old enough to leave the nest for foraging. In order to retain her sitting position eggs for as long as possible she first constructs a little wax pot filled with sweet nectar next to the nest that she can sip from so that doesnâ€™t have to leave her young too often."
